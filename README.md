# Amazon-Price-Tracker
I develop and sell the Amazon Price Tracker browser extension that helps users track product prices on Amazon.com. The extension monitors price changes and sends notifications when prices drop. Customers learn about my product through Chrome Web Store and I charge through monthly/annual subscription plans for premium features.
